00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Hello I'm Adewumi

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.900
I'm a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.333
Agricultural Economics student here

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.968
I just graduated last December and presently, I'm a AltShooler

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.976
I'm a Cloud Engineering student at AltSchool Africa

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.900
and this is actually my first course in tech

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.976
Although it has been challenging, at the same time, it has been exciting

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.208
The assignments...I'm actually proud of the things I've been able to achieve with the assignments

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.648
I'm proud of myself, and I really can't wait to graduate.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.968
I look forward to graduating, let's say in October or November

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.976
Whenever it is this year, I look forward to doing that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.184
...and most of the time...okay
My major work at the moment; I'm a freelance writer

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.504
I write.
So when I'm not working, the you'll see me trying to cover the classes, videos

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.504
on the LMS page.
When I'm not doing that, then I'm probably trying to do my assignments

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.696
or talking to some of my colleagues at AltSchool
trying to figure out some things together

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.352
and when I'm not working or watching videos, my hobbies are swimming

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.608
I swim in my leisure time, I swim, I read books, I sleep...(chuckles)...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.224
I eat...I see movies...and those are basically my hobbies for now.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.568
...and welcome to my webpage.
This is an entry for the second assignment we'll be having

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.333
as a cloud engineering student.
Bye.
