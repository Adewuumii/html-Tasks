        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Adewumi Ajibade. I am a native of Iloro-Ekiti in Ekiti
          State, Nigeria, but I was born and raised in Osogbo, Osun State,
          Nigeria, as the second daughter of three girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed my primary school education at Faith Nursery and Primary
          School, Osogbo; proceeded to Osogbo Grammar School for my secondary
          education, and recently graduated with a degree in Agricultural
          Economics from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a recent graduate awaiting my NYSC call-up from the federal
          government, I work as a freelance academic writer. I have also
          recently enrolled in a Cloud Engineering course at AltSchool Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may not have many hobbies, but I totally enjoy the ones I currently
          pursue and am open to exploring new ones as time goes on. My present
          hobbies are swimming, reading, and cooking. I swim at least twice a
          week and read as many books as time permits. I enjoy cooking because I
          like to eat good and healthy meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have refined my problem-solving abilities, worked
          with others on diverse projects, and cultivated a mindset geared
          toward continuous learning. My professional and personal experiences
          have equipped me with the resilience and adaptability needed to thrive
          in a dynamic environment.

      <section id="Why I Joined the Program">
        <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
        <p>
          I joined the program because I aspire to become a cloud engineer. I
          chose to learn this skill through an organization that offers a
          comprehensive curriculum rather than attempting to learn independently
          online without proper guidance. AltSchool's innovative curriculum
          provides the perfect balance of theoretical knowledge and hands-on
          experience, preparing students to handle real life problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          AltSchool also place much emphasis on community-driven collaboration
          and mentorship which resonates deeply with me. I was inspired by the
          program's mission to empower aspiring engineers to become world-class
          professionals, and I can't wait to contribute to and grow within this
          dynamic ecosystem.

      <section id="my goals">
        <h2>My Goals for the Program</h2>
        <p>My goals upon completing this program are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Master Core Technical Skills:</b>
            <p>
              My primary goal is to gain proficient knowledge in key programming
              languages, algorithms, and system design.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Develop Real-World Projects:</b>
            <p>
              Through AltSchool's hands-on learning approach, I plan to work on
              diverse projects that solve meaningful problems. This will assist
              me in building a portfolio that highlights my abilities in
              addition to improving my technical proficiency.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Contribute to a Collaborative Environment:</b>
            <p>
              I hope to work and relate well with my peers, mentors, and
              instructors to foster a community of innovation and growth. I
              would also love to improve my abilities and widen my horizons by
              sharing knowledge and learning from others.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Build a Successful Career:</b>
            <p>
              My ultimate goal is to graduate from the school as a self-assured,
              capable engineer prepared to contribute significantly to the tech
              industry.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This program is not just an academic pursuit for me; it is a stepping
          stone toward my dream of becoming a transformative force in the world
          of engineering.
